        <h1>About:</h1>
        <p>This is a website that allows students to bypass
            school computers by using code I have made.</p>
            <p>It all started whenever I created my first hack to bypass a school game called blooket</p>
            <p>ive always had a love for coding and hacking but since then It has changed to a passion to always have a way to reverse engineer and work around schools blocking systems</p>
<P>now I would like to specify that I never use my knowledge and what I make for bad, It is simply for fun and now I am sharing it with other people. I am a student at dublin city schools</P>    
 <p>some of the glitches,cheats, and hacks might not work for people outside of dublin but all the school game cheats liek my blooket hacks will work on any laptop/computer</p>
